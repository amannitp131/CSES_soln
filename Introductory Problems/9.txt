Important points used in solving the permutation generation problem:

1. Backtracking/Recursion:
   - The solution uses a recursive function to generate all possible permutations of the input string.

2. Tracking Used Characters:
   - A boolean vector tracks which characters have been used in the current permutation to avoid repetition.

3. Avoiding Duplicates:
   - A set is used to store permutations, ensuring only unique permutations are kept (handles repeated characters in the input).

4. Base Case:
   - When the temporary string reaches the length of the input, it is added to the set of results.

5. Output:
   - After generating all unique permutations, the code prints the total count and each permutation in lexicographical order.
